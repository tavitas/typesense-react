Pacific island countries have yet to overcome the challenge of providing a safe and adequate supply of drinking water to its populations. Infectious, waterborne diseases, such as Typhoid and Cholera and newly emerging pathogens are a major cause of morbidity and mortality within the Pacific region.\r\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) report that about 2 million people in the world die each year due to diarrhoeal diseases, most of them are children less that 5 years of age. The worst affected are the populations in developing countries. Lack of access to safe drinking water is one of the main contributors to this situation.\r\nTraditional approaches that rely on sampling and testing water have failed to achieve extensive improvement in access to safe drinking water. Pacific island countries are committed to achieving targets specified in the Millennium Development Goals (2000), including halving the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water by 2015. A new strategy is now being promoted globally that is based on risk management principles – drinking water safety planning.",

					"description": "Two thirds of the population of the Kingdom of Tonga, live on the small, South Pacific raised\r\nlimestone island of Tongatapu. Groundwater is the principle source of reticulated fresh water both in\r\nthe capital Nuku’alofa and in rural villages and is sourced from a relatively thin, fresh groundwater lens\r\noverlying seawater. This paper describes a comprehensive, integrated assessment of the vulnerability\r\nof fresh groundwater in Tongatapu. Water resources policy and legislation, and the organisation\r\nstructures for regulating and managing of water were examined. Threats to groundwater from\r\nseawater intrusion, overpumping, agriculture, waste disposal, industry, quarrying, urban settlements,\r\npopulation growth, droughts and climate change were analysed using existing data and field\r\nmeasurements. The impact of pumping on freshwater salinity is clearly discernible within ENSO\r\nsignatures. Suggestions are made for improving the protection of water resources, mitigating saline\r\nwater impacts, enhancing freshwater supplies and for reforming regulation and management.",

In mid-2016 FAO recruited a consultant with experience in community-based fisheries management and in Tonga fisheries to undertake the review. The general plan was to examine the major issues of the SMA program, especially those dealing with establishment, monitoring, costs, and benefits – and make recommendations for improving the program.",

The mission included coral reef assessments, coral reef\r\nresearch, habitat mapping, and educational activities.  The objectives of the mission were to:\r\n\r\n1) Identify and characterize shallow marine habitats and develop habitat and bathymetric maps:\r\n2) Evaluate the composition, structure and health of coral reefs using a standardized assessment protocol;\r\n3) Evaluate the effects of environmental stressors on coral health and subcellular changes through biomarker\r\nexpression;\r\n4) Assess the diversity, abundance and population structure of fishes, corals and other invertebrates, and algae,\r\nincluding commercially valuable species;\r\n5) Document the impacts of broad scale disturbances and patterns of recovery with emphasis on Tsunami\r\ndamage in Niua;\r\n6) Measure ocean chemistry (pH) and effects on coral growth; and\r\n7) Characterize the types of symbionts in reef building corals and variations in their photosynthetic efficiency\r\nunder different environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nThe project was conducted in partnership with the Ministry of Lands, Environment, Climate Change & Natural Resources (MLECCNR), Ministry of Agriculture, Forests and Fisheries (MAFF) and Vava'u Environmental Protection Association (VEPA), with involvement of scientists from Nova Southeastern University, University of the Azores, University of the Philippines, NOAA/University of Miami, Atlantic and Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment Program (AGRRA), and the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium (Taiwan)",

			"description": "The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is the most comprehensive global database of marine and terrestrial protected areas, updated on a monthly basis, and is one of the key global biodiversity data sets being widely used by scientists, businesses, governments, International secretariats and others to inform planning, policy decisions and management.\r\n\r\nThe WDPA is a joint project between UN Environment and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The compilation and management of the WDPA is carried out by UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), in collaboration with governments, non-governmental organisations, academia and industry. There are monthly updates of the data which are made available online through the Protected Planet website where the data is both viewable and downloadable.\r\n\r\nData and information on the world's protected areas compiled in the WDPA are used for reporting to the Convention on Biological Diversity on progress towards reaching the Aichi Biodiversity Targets (particularly Target 11), to the UN to track progress towards the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, to some of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) core indicators, and other international assessments and reports including the Global Biodiversity Outlook, as well as for the publication of the United Nations List of Protected Areas. Every two years, UNEP-WCMC releases the Protected Planet Report on the status of the world's protected areas and recommendations on how to meet international goals and targets.\r\n\r\nMany platforms are incorporating the WDPA to provide integrated information to diverse users, including businesses and governments, in a range of sectors including mining, oil and gas, and finance. For example, the WDPA is included in the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool, an innovative decision support tool that gives users easy access to up-to-date information that allows them to identify biodiversity risks and opportunities within a project boundary.\r\n\r\nThe reach of the WDPA is further enhanced in services developed by other parties, such as the Global Forest Watch and the Digital Observatory for Protected Areas, which provide decision makers with access to monitoring and alert systems that allow whole landscapes to be managed better. Together, these applications of the WDPA demonstrate the growing value and significance of the Protected Planet initiative.",

			"description": "Environmental conditions and anthropogenic impacts are key influences on ecological processes and associated ecosystem services. Effective management of Tonga’s marine ecosystems therefore depends on accurate and up-to-date knowledge of environmental and anthropogenic variables. Although many types of environmental and anthropogenic data are now available in global layers, they are often inaccessible to end users, particularly in developing countries with limited accessibility and analytical training. Furthermore, the resolution of many global layers might not be sufficient to make informed local decisions. Although the near-shore marine ecosystem of Tonga is extensive, the resources available for its management are limited and little is known about its current ecological state. Here we provide a marine socio-environmental dataset covering Tonga’s near-shore marine ecosystem as compiled from various global layers, remote sensing projects, local ministries, and the 2016 national census. The dataset consists of 11 environmental and 6 anthropogenic variables summarized in ecologically relevant ways, spatially overlaid across the near-shore marine ecosystem of Tonga. The environmental variables selected include: bathymetry, coral reef density, distance from deep water, distance from land, distance from major terrestrial inputs, habitat, land area, net primary productivity, salinity, sea surface temperature, and wave energy. The anthropogenic variables selected include: fishing pressure, management status, distance to fish markets, distance from villages, population pressure, and a socioeconomic development index based on population density, growth, mean age, mean education level, and unemployment. This extensive and accessible dataset will be a useful tool for future assessment and management of marine ecosystems in Tonga.",

The guidelines can also be used by\r\nother government sectors in terms of developing and implementing new policies and programs for the\r\ngovernment. These guidelines can also provide useful assistance to non-governmental organisations,\r\ncommunities and all those seeking to broaden their capacities, with a view of better informed public\r\nparticipation in strategic planning.",

The present work seeks to extend that argument into prehistory by examining the relationship of ancient habitation sites and size of aroid pit agricultural systems to atoll land area and rainfall regime along the 1,500-3,500 mm precipitation gradient in the Marshall Islands. Four atolls were selected for study: Ebon at the wettest extent in the extreme south; Ujae and Maloelap near the center of the archipelago; and Utrok at the dry north. The first phase of this long-term archaeological program is reported.

In Tefisi, the surface soil is washed away from land development sites, farmland and the settlement areas in every significant rainfall. The fine soil particles flow into the coastal marine environment unchecked, causing the otherwise clear marine environment to become turbid. The outflow of soil not only destroys the ecosystems of the coastal environment, but seriously impacts the local fishery.</p>\n",

Overall, bird numbers appear to be similar or slightly lower than those recorded in 2000.It is not clear if the lower numbers reported represent any real shift from natural variation due to such factors as storm damage to breeding sites, however it is noted that when compared with earlier survey results (1972-1992) numbers of Sooty Tern, Red-taileded Tropicbird and Brown Booby have tended to trend downwards.</p>\n",

Prior knowledge of the biota of Caroline Atoll is very scant, deriving almost entirely from the visits of F. D. Bennett in 1835, Devoy in 1875, and the U.S.S. Hartford in 1883. This paper summarizes earlier data and presents recent POBSP observations on the flora and terrestrial vertebrates, identifying many of them for the first time</p>\n",

Finally, policy recommendations based on indigenous knowledge research are offered.</p>\n",

Tarawa typifies the increasingly common condition of resource depletion and marine community structure change with expanding human activities and population growth. Fisheries-dependent reports have documented the change in fisher landings for nearly two decades. A comparison of fisheries-independent data collected during 1992-93 with data collected in 1977 allowed for documentation of large changes in important finfish resources in Tarawa Lagoon. The historically important bonefish (Albula glossodonta), like other important fishery species, demonstrated declines in catch-per-unit effort (CPUE), proportion of catch, mean length and weight (1977: 46.4 cm, 1.31 kg; 1992-93: 37.6 cm and 0.84 kg), and sex ratio (1977: 0.71:1 [F:M]; 1992-93: 0.15:1). Beach seine sampling of bait fishes demonstrated a major shift in species composition between 1977 and 1992- 93, with severe depletion of some preferred species.

It is argued that integration will enhance locally appropriate and sustainable outcomes necessary for effective forest conservation in the context of rural Vanuatu.

The approach is illustrated by a discussion of vulnerability and local development needs in the Tangoa Island community, South Santo, Vanuatu - a community particularly affected by tropical cyclones. Although effective adaptive strategies have evolved over time in Tangoa, these are unlikely to withstand the likely changes in magnitude and (perhaps) frequency of cyclones into the future with climate change. This is due to evolving non-climate stresses that largely intersect with locally defined development needs. Opportunities exist to reduce vulnerability to climate change by development pathways that address particular non-climate stresses.

			"description": "Bioregions, of course, are just one of the important data layers in indentifying an ecologically representative system of marine protected areas. To be truly ecologically representative and comprehensive, one must also consider all available information about habitats, species and ecological processes. In addition, socio-economic and cultural considerations are vital in the spatial planning process. This report is focussed upon one important, but only one, input to marine spatial planning: the development of marine bioregions.\r\n\r\nTo take account of differing types and resolution of data, two separate bioregionalisations were developed; firstly, for the deepwater environments and secondly for reef-associated environments. For the deepwater, thirty, mainly physical, environmental variables were assessed to be adequately comprehensive and reliable to be included in the analysis. These data were allocated to over 140 000 grid cells of 20x20 km across the Southwest Pacific. K-means and then hierarchical cluster analyses were then conducted to identify groups of analytical units that contained similar environmental conditions. The number of clusters was determined by examining the dendrogram and setting a similarity value that aligned with a natural break in similarity.\r\n\r\nFor the second bioregionalisation, reef-associated datasets of more than 200 fish, coral and other invertebrate species were collated from multiple data providers who sampled over 6500 sites. We combined these datasets, which were quality-checked for taxonomic consistency and normalised, resulting in more than 800 species that could be used in further analysis. All these species data and seven independent environmental datasets were then allocated to over 45,000 grid cells of 9x9 km across the SW Pacific. Next, the probability of observing these species was predicted, using the environmental variables, for grid cells within the unsurveyed reef-associated habitats. Hierarchical cluster analysis was then applied to the reef-associated datasets to deliver clusters of grid cells with high similarity.\r\n\r\nThe final analytical steps, applied to all the outputs, were to refine the resulting clusters using manual spatial processing and to describe each cluster to deliver the draft bioregions. This work resulted in 262 draft deepwater marine bioregions and 102 draft reef-associated bioregions across the SW Pacific.\r\n\r\nPlease cite this dataset as:\r\nWendt H., Beger M., Sullivan J., LeGrand J., Davey K., Yakub N., Fernandes L.  2018.

			"description": "AquaMaps are computer-generated predictions of natural occurrence of marine species, based on the environmental tolerance of a given species with respect to depth, salinity, temperature, primary productivity, and its association with sea ice or coastal areas. These 'environmental envelopes' are matched against an authority file which contains respective information for the Oceans of the World. Independent knowledge such as distribution by FAO areas or bounding boxes are used to avoid mapping species in areas that contain suitable habitat, but are not occupied by the species. Maps show the color-coded likelihood of a species to occur in a half-degree cell, with about 50 km side length near the equator. Experts are able to review, modify and approve maps.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental envelopes are created in part (FAO areas, bounding boxes, depth ranges) from respective information in species databases such as FishBase and in part from occurrence records available from OBIS or GBIF. AquaMaps predictions have been validated successfully for a number of species using independent data sets and the model was shown to perform equally well or better than other standard species distribution models, when faced with the currently existing suboptimal input data sets (Ready et al. 2010).\r\n\r\nThe creation of AquaMaps is supported by the following projects: MARA, Pew Fellows Program in Marine Conservation, INCOFISH, Sea Around Us, and Biogeoinformatics of Hexacorals.\r\n\r\nKaschner, K., D.P.

Allen Family Foundation to provide African and Asian countries with more accurate and comprehensive fisheries data.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Around Us provides data and analyses through View Data, articles in peer-reviewed journals, and other media (News). The Sea Around Us regularly update products at the scale of countries’ Exclusive Economic Zones, Large Marine Ecosystems, the High Seas and other spatial scales, and as global maps and summaries.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Around Us emphasizes catch time series starting in 1950, and related series (e.g., landed value and catch by flag state, fishing sector and catch type), and fisheries-related information on every maritime country (e.g., government subsidies, marine biodiversity). Information is also offered on sub-projects, e.g., the historic expansion of fisheries, the performance of Regional Fisheries Management Organizations, or the likely impact of climate change on fisheries.\r\n\r\nThe information and data presented on their website is freely available to any user, granted that its source is acknowledged.

			"description": "The Western and Central Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) have compiled a public domain version of aggregated catch and effort data using operational, aggregate and annual catch estimates data provided by Commission Members (CCMs) and Cooperating Non-members (CNMs). The data provided herein have been prepared for dissemination in accordance with the current “Rules and Procedures for the Protection, Access to, and Dissemination of Data Compiled by the Commission” or (“RAP”).\r\n\r\nParagraph 9 of the Rules and Procedures indicates that \"Catch and Effort data in the public domain shall be made up of observations from a minimum of three vessels\". However, the majority of aggregate data provided to WPCFC do not indicate how many vessels were active in each cell of data which would allow data to be directly filtered according to this rule. Instead, the individual cells where \"effort\" is less than or equal to the maximum value estimated to represent the activities of two vessels have been removed from the public domain data (the cells are retained with their time/area information, but all catch and effort information in these have been set to zero). Statistics showing how much data have been removed according to this RAP requirement are provided in the documentation for the longline and purse seine public domain data.\r\n\r\nAll public domain data have been aggregated by year/month and 5°x5° grid. Annex 2 of the RAP indicates that public domain aggregated catch/effort data can be made available at a higher resolution (e.g. data with a breakdown by vessel nation, and aggregated by 1°x1° grids for surface fisheries); however, if the public domain data were provided at these higher levels of resolution implementation of the RAP \"three-vessel rule\" with the current aggregate data set would result in too many cells being removed.\r\n\r\nHowever, please note that the data that have been removed from the public domain dataset, available on this webpage, are still potentially accessible via other provisions of the RAP (refer to section 4.6 and para 34).\r\n\r\n Each public domain zip file contains two files: (1) a CSV file containing the data; (2) a PDF file containing the field names/formats and the coverage with respect to the data file.\r\n\r\nThese data files were last updated on the 27th July 2020.",

					"description": "This dataset contains rasters and a metadata file for global mean monthly sea surface temperature (°C) from 2010-2019.  Rasters are in WGS84 coordinate system (EPSG 4326).  Sea surface temperature is the temperature of the top millimeter of the ocean's surface. Sea surface temperatures influence weather, including hurricanes, as well as plant and animal life in the ocean. Like Earth's land surface, sea surface temperatures are warmer near the equator and colder near the poles. Currents like giant rivers move warm and cold water around the world's oceans. Some of these currents flow on the surface, and they are obvious in sea surface temperature images.\r\n\r\nWarm ocean waters help form clouds and affect weather patterns. The sea's surface temperature is also correlated to the availability of tiny ocean plants, called phytoplankton. For all of these reasons scientists monitor the sea's surface temperature. These maps show satellite measurements of the sea's surface temperature for a given day, or for a span of days.\r\n\r\nNASA standard processing and distribution of the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) products from the MODIS sensors is now performed using software developed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). The OBPG generates Level-2 SST products using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 software (l2gen), which is the same software used to generate MODIS ocean color products. The SST algorithm and quality assessment logic are the responsibility of the MODIS Science Team Leads for SST (currently P. Minnett and R. Evans of the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami). Details of the SST processing implementation within l2gen are provided in this document. The description is valid for both the standard products distributed by the OBPG through the ocean color web and the products delivered to the Physical Oceanography DAAC, where the latter are subsequently repackaged for GHRSST distribution.\r\n\r\nAn historical discussion on the transition of SST processing from MODAPS/DAAC/RSMAS to OBPG, with comparison of products, is available here. At the time of transition, the OBPG was able to demonstrate exact consistency with the previous products. However, file formatting now follows OBPG conventions.\r\n\r\nThe Short-wave SST Algorithm makes use of MODIS bands 22 and 23 at 3.959 and 4.050 um. The brightness temperatures are derived from the observed radiances by inversion (in log space) of the radiance versus blackbody temperature relationship. For l2gen, these relationships were precomputed for the spectral response of each MODIS channel, and the tables were then stored in HDF files to be loaded at run-time. In modsst, the radiance versus blackbody temperature relationship was computed at run-time. The algorithm for computing short-wave SST (sst4) from observed brightness temperatures is shown below.\r\n\r\nThe long-wave SST algorithm makes use of MODIS bands 31 and 32 at 11 amd 12 um. The brightness temperatures are derived from the observed radiances by inversion (in linear space) of the radiance versus blackbody temperature relationship. For l2gen, these relationships were precomputed for the spectral response of each MODIS channel, and the tables were then stored in HDF files to be loaded at run-time. In modsst, the radiance versus blackbody temperature relationship was computed at run-time. The nonlinear SST algorithm was tuned for two different regimes based on brightness temperature difference. The algorithm for computing long-wave SST (sst) from observed brightness temperatures is shown below. Support for the VIIRS mission is currently work in progress.",

					"description": "This dataset contains rasters and a metadata file for global mean monthly ocean chlorophyll concentration (mg/m3) from 2010-2019. Rasters are in WGS84 coordinate system (EPSG 4326) .  Chlorophyll-a is the light-harvesting pigment found in all photosynthetic plants. Its concentration in the ocean is used as an index of phytoplankton biomass and, as such, is a key input to primary productivity models. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites measures ocean color every day, from which global chlorophyll-a concentrations are derived.\r\n\r\nOcean phytoplankton chemically fix carbon through photosynthesis, taking in dissolved carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. Through this process, marine plants capture about an equal amount of carbon as does photosynthesis by land vegetation. Changes in the amount of phytoplankton indicate the change in productivity of the oceans and provide a key ocean link for global climate change monitoring. Scientists use chlorophyll in modeling Earth's biogeochemical cycles such as the carbon cycle or the nitrogen cycle. Additionally, on short time scales, chlorophyll can be used to trace oceanographic currents, jets, and plumes. The 1-km resolution and nearly daily global coverage of the MODIS data thus allows scientists to observe mesoscale oceanographic features in coastal and estuarine environments, which are of increasing importance in marine science studies.\r\n\r\nThe MODIS Chlorophyll-a product provides an estimate of the near-surface concentration of chlorophyll calculated using an empirical relationship derived from in situ measurements of chlorophyll and remote sensing reflectances (Rrs) in the blue-to-green region of the visible spectrum. The implementation is contingent on the availability of three or more sensor bands spanning the 440 - 670 nm spectral regime. The current implementation for the default chlorophyll algorithm (chlor_a) employs the standard band ratio algorithm (OCx) merged with the color index (CI) of Hu et al. (2012). As described in that paper, this refinement is restricted to relatively clear water, and the general impact is to reduce artifacts and biases in clear-water chlorophyll retrievals due to residual glint, stray light, atmospheric correction errors, and white or spectrally-linear bias errors in Rrs. As implemented, the algorithm diverges slightly from what was published in Hu et al. (2012) in that the transition between the CI and OCx now occurs at 0.15 < CI < 0.2 mg/m-3 to ensure a smooth transition.\r\n\r\nThese imagery are produced using 2014.0 OCI chlorophyll data.\r\n\r\nReferences for above:  Hu, C., Z.

					"description": "GeoJSON file for earthquake centers over a magnitude of 4.5 for the Pacific Islands Region for years 2000-2004.  Data are derived from the ANSS Comprehensive Earthquake Catalog (ComCat).  ComCat contains earthquake source parameters (e.g. hypocenters, magnitudes, phase picks and amplitudes) and other products (e.g. moment tensor solutions, macroseismic information, tectonic summaries, maps) produced by contributing seismic networks.\r\n\r\nFields are defined below:\r\nalert\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: “green”, “yellow”, “orange”, “red”.\r\nDescription: The alert level from the PAGER earthquake impact scale.\r\n\r\ncdi\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0.0, 10.0]\r\nDescription: The maximum reported intensity for the event. Computed by DYFI. While typically reported as a roman numeral, for the purposes of this API, intensity is expected as the decimal equivalent of the roman numeral. Learn more about magnitude vs. intensity.\r\n\r\ncode\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: \"2013lgaz\", \"c000f1jy\", \"71935551\"\r\nDescription: An identifying code assigned by - and unique from - the corresponding source for the event.\r\n\r\nDepth\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0, 1000]\r\nDescription: Depth of the event in kilometers.\r\nAdditional Information: The depth where the earthquake begins to rupture. This depth may be relative to the WGS84 geoid, mean sea-level, or the average elevation of the seismic stations which provided arrival-time data for the earthquake location. The choice of reference depth is dependent on the method used to locate the earthquake, which varies by seismic network. Since ComCat includes data from many different seismic networks, the process for determining the depth is different for different events. The depth is the least-constrained parameter in the earthquake location, and the error bars are generally larger than the variation due to different depth determination methods.\r\n\r\nSometimes when depth is poorly constrained by available seismic data, the location program will set the depth at a fixed value. For example, 33 km is often used as a default depth for earthquakes determined to be shallow, but whose depth is not satisfactorily determined by the data, whereas default depths of 5 or 10 km are often used in mid-continental areas and on mid-ocean ridges since earthquakes in these areas are usually shallower than 33 km.\r\n\r\ndepthError\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0, 100]\r\nDescription: Uncertainty of reported depth of the event in kilometers.\r\nAdditional Information: The depth error, in km, defined as the largest projection of the three principal errors on a vertical line.\r\n\r\ndetail\r\nData Type: String\r\nDescription: Link to GeoJSON detail feed from a GeoJSON summary feed.\r\nNOTE: When searching and using geojson with callback, no callback is included in the detail url.\r\n\r\ndmin\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0.4, 7.1]\r\nDescription: Horizontal distance from the epicenter to the nearest station (in degrees). 1 degree is approximately 111.2 kilometers. In general, the smaller this number, the more reliable is the calculated depth of the earthquake.\r\n\r\nfelt\r\nData Type: Integer\r\nTypical Values: [44, 843]\r\nDescription: The total number of felt reports submitted to the DYFI? system.\r\n\r\ngap\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0.0, 180.0]\r\nDescription: The largest azimuthal gap between azimuthally adjacent stations (in degrees). In general, the smaller this number, the more reliable is the calculated horizontal position of the earthquake. Earthquake locations in which the azimuthal gap exceeds 180 degrees typically have large location and depth uncertainties.\r\n\r\nhorizontalError\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0, 100]\r\nDescription: Uncertainty of reported location of the event in kilometers.\r\nAdditional Information: The horizontal location error, in km, defined as the length of the largest projection of the three principal errors on a horizontal plane. The principal errors are the major axes of the error ellipsoid, and are mutually perpendicular. The horizontal and vertical uncertainties in an event's location varies from about 100 m horizontally and 300 meters vertically for the best located events, those in the middle of densely spaced seismograph networks, to 10s of kilometers for global events in many parts of the world. We report an \"unknown\" value if the contributing seismic network does not supply uncertainty estimates.\r\n\r\nid\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: A (generally) two-character network identifier with a (generally) eight-character network-assigned code.\r\nDescription: A unique identifier for the event.

Negative values for southern latitudes.\r\nAdditional Information: An earthquake begins to rupture at a hypocenter which is defined by a position on the surface of the earth (epicenter) and a depth below this point (focal depth). We provide the coordinates of the epicenter in units of latitude and longitude. The latitude is the number of degrees north (N) or south (S) of the equator and varies from 0 at the equator to 90 at the poles. The longitude is the number of degrees east (E) or west (W) of the prime meridian which runs through Greenwich, England. The longitude varies from 0 at Greenwich to 180 and the E or W shows the direction from Greenwich. Coordinates are given in the WGS84 reference frame. The position uncertainty of the hypocenter location varies from about 100 m horizontally and 300 meters vertically for the best located events, those in the middle of densely spaced seismograph networks, to 10s of kilometers for global events in many parts of the world.\r\n\r\nlocationSource\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: ak, at, ci, hv, ld, mb, nc, nm, nn, pr, pt, se, us, uu, uw\r\nDescription: The network that originally authored the reported location of this event.\r\n\r\nlongitude\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [-180.0, 180.0]\r\nDescription: Decimal degrees longitude. Negative values for western longitudes.\r\nAdditional Information: An earthquake begins to rupture at a hypocenter which is defined by a position on the surface of the earth (epicenter) and a depth below this point (focal depth). We provide the coordinates of the epicenter in units of latitude and longitude. The latitude is the number of degrees north (N) or south (S) of the equator and varies from 0 at the equator to 90 at the poles.

See also magType.\r\nAdditional Information: The magnitude reported is that which the U.S. Geological Survey considers official for this earthquake, and was the best available estimate of the earthquake’s size, at the time that this page was created. Other magnitudes associated with web pages linked from here are those determined at various times following the earthquake with different types of seismic data. Although they are legitimate estimates of magnitude, the U.S. Geological Survey does not consider them to be the preferred \"official\" magnitude for the event.\r\n\r\nEarthquake magnitude is a measure of the size of an earthquake at its source. It is a logarithmic measure. At the same distance from the earthquake, the amplitude of the seismic waves from which the magnitude is determined are approximately 10 times as large during a magnitude 5 earthquake as during a magnitude 4 earthquake. The total amount of energy released by the earthquake usually goes up by a larger factor: for many commonly used magnitude types, the total energy of an average earthquake goes up by a factor of approximately 32 for each unit increase in magnitude.\r\n\r\nThere are various ways that magnitude may be calculated from seismograms. Different methods are effective for different sizes of earthquakes and different distances between the earthquake source and the recording station. The various magnitude types are generally defined so as to yield magnitude values that agree to within a few-tenths of a magnitude-unit for earthquakes in a middle range of recorded-earthquake sizes, but the various magnitude-types may have values that differ by more than a magnitude-unit for very large and very small earthquakes as well as for some specific classes of seismic source. This is because earthquakes are commonly complex events that release energy over a wide range of frequencies and at varying amounts as the faulting or rupture process occurs. The various types of magnitude measure different aspects of the seismic radiation (e.g., low-frequency energy vs. high-frequency energy). The relationship among values of different magnitude types that are assigned to a particular seismic event may enable the seismologist to better understand the processes at the focus of the seismic event. The various magnitude-types are not all available at the same time for a particular earthquake.\r\n\r\nPreliminary magnitudes based on incomplete but rapidly-available data are sometimes estimated and reported. For example, the Tsunami Warning Centers will calculate a preliminary magnitude and location for an event as soon as sufficient data are available to make an estimate. In this case, time is of the essence in order to broadcast a warning if tsunami waves are likely to be generated by the event. Such preliminary magnitudes are superseded by improved estimates of magnitude as more data become available.\r\n\r\nFor large earthquakes of the present era, the magnitude that is ultimately selected as the preferred magnitude for reporting to the public is commonly a moment magnitude that is based on the scalar seismic-moment of an earthquake determined by calculation of the seismic moment-tensor that best accounts for the character of the seismic waves generated by the earthquake. The scalar seismic-moment, a parameter of the seismic moment-tensor, can also be estimated via the multiplicative product rigidity of faulted rock x area of fault rupture x average fault displacement during the earthquake.\r\n\r\nmagError\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0, 100]\r\nDescription: Uncertainty of reported magnitude of the event. The estimated standard error of the magnitude. The uncertainty corresponds to the specific magnitude type being reported and does not take into account magnitude variations and biases between different magnitude scales. We report an \"unknown\" value if the contributing seismic network does not supply uncertainty estimates.\r\n\r\nmagNst\r\nData Type: Integer\r\nDescription: The total number of seismic stations used to calculate the magnitude for this earthquake.\r\n\r\nmagSource\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: ak, at, ci, hv, ld, mb, nc, nm, nn, pr, pt, se, us, uu, uw\r\nDescription: Network that originally authored the reported magnitude for this event.\r\n\r\nmagType\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: “Md”, “Ml”, “Ms”, “Mw”, “Me”, “Mi”, “Mb”, “MLg”\r\nDescription: The method or algorithm used to calculate the preferred magnitude for the event.\r\nAdditional Information: See Magnitude Types Table.\r\n\r\nmmi\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values:[0.0, 10.0]\r\nDescription: The maximum estimated instrumental intensity for the event. Computed by ShakeMap. While typically reported as a roman numeral, for the purposes of this API, intensity is expected as the decimal equivalent of the roman numeral. Learn more about magnitude vs. intensity.\r\n\r\nnet\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: ak, at, ci, hv, ld, mb, nc, nm, nn, pr, pt, se, us, uu, uw\r\nDescription: The ID of a data contributor. Identifies the network considered to be the preferred source of information for this event.\r\n\r\nnph\r\nData Type: String\r\nDescription: Number of Phases Used.  Number of P and S arrival-time observations used to compute the hypocenter location. Increased numbers of arrival-time observations generally result in improved earthquake locations.\r\n\r\nnst\r\nData Type: Integer\r\nDescription: The total number of seismic stations used to determine earthquake location.\r\nAdditional Information: Number of seismic stations which reported P- and S-arrival times for this earthquake. This number may be larger than the Number of Phases Used if arrival times are rejected because the distance to a seismic station exceeds the maximum allowable distance or because the arrival-time observation is inconsistent with the solution.\r\n\r\nplace\r\nData Type: String\r\nDescription: Textual description of named geographic region near to the event. This may be a city name, or a Flinn-Engdahl Region name.\r\nAdditional Information: We use a GeoNames dataset to reference populated places that are in close proximity to a seismic event. GeoNames has compiled a list of cities in the United States where the population is 1,000 or greater (cities1000.txt). This is the primary list that we use when selecting nearby places. In order to provide the public with a better understanding for the location of an event we try to list a variety of places in our nearby places list. This includes the closest known populated place in relation to the seismic event (which based on our dataset will have a population of 1,000 or greater). We also include the next 3 closest places that have a population of 10,000 or greater, and finally make sure to include the closest capital city to the seismic event.\r\n\r\nThe reference point for the descriptive locations is usually either the City Hall of the town (or prominent intersection in the middle of town if there is no City Hall), but please refer to the GeoNames website for the most accurate information on their data.\r\n\r\nIf there is no nearby city within 300 kilometers (or if the nearby cities database is unavailable for some reason), the Flinn-Engdahl (F-E) seismic and geographical regionalization scheme is used. The boundaries of these regions are defined at one-degree intervals and therefore differ from irregular political boundaries. For example, F-E region 545 (Northern Italy) also includes small parts of France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia and F-E region 493 (Chesapeake Bay Region) includes all of the State of Delaware, plus parts of the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Beginning with January 2000, the 1995 revision to the F-E code has been used in the QED and PDE listings.\r\n\r\nAs an agency of the U.S. Government, we are expected to use the names and spellings approved by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. Any requests to approve additional names should be made to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.\r\n\r\nrms\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0.13,1.39]\r\nDescription: The root-mean-square (RMS) travel time residual, in sec, using all weights. This parameter provides a measure of the fit of the observed arrival times to the predicted arrival times for this location. Smaller numbers reflect a better fit of the data. The value is dependent on the accuracy of the velocity model used to compute the earthquake location, the quality weights assigned to the arrival time data, and the procedure used to locate the earthquake.\r\n\r\nsig\r\nData Type: Integer\r\nTypical Values: [0, 1000]\r\nDescription: A number describing how significant the event is. Larger numbers indicate a more significant event. This value is determined on a number of factors, including: magnitude, maximum MMI, felt reports, and estimated impact.\r\n\r\nsources\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: \",us,nc,ci,\"\r\nDescription: A comma-separated list of network contributors.\r\n\r\nstatus\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: “automatic”, “reviewed”, “deleted”\r\nDescription: Indicates whether the event has been reviewed by a human.\r\nAdditional Information\r\nStatus is either automatic or reviewed. Automatic events are directly posted by automatic processing systems and have not been verified or altered by a human. Reviewed events have been looked at by a human. The level of review can range from a quick validity check to a careful reanalysis of the event.\r\n\r\ntime\r\nData Type: Long Integer\r\nDescription: Time when the event occurred. Times are reported in milliseconds since the epoch ( 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z), and do not include leap seconds. In certain output formats, the date is formatted for readability.\r\nAdditional Information: We indicate the date and time when the earthquake initiates rupture, which is known as the \"origin\" time. Note that large earthquakes can continue rupturing for many 10's of seconds. We provide time in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). Seismologists use UTC to avoid confusion caused by local time zones and daylight savings time. On the individual event pages, times are also provided for the time at the epicenter, and your local time based on the time your computer is set.\r\n\r\ntsunami\r\nData Type: Integer\r\nDescription: This flag is set to \"1\" for large events in oceanic regions and \"0\" otherwise. The existence or value of this flag does not indicate if a tsunami actually did or will exist. If the flag value is \"1\", the event will include a link to the NOAA Tsunami website for tsunami information. The USGS is not responsible for Tsunami warning; we are simply providing a link to the authoritative NOAA source.\r\nSee http://www.tsunami.gov/ for all current tsunami alert statuses.\r\n\r\ntype\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: “earthquake”, “quarry”\r\nDescription: Type of seismic event.\r\n\r\ntypes\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: “,cap,dyfi,general-link,origin,p-wave-travel-times,phase-data,”\r\nDescription: A comma-separated list of product types associated to this event.\r\ntz\r\nData Type: Integer\r\nTypical Values: [-1200, +1200]\r\nDescription: Timezone offset from UTC in minutes at the event epicenter.\r\n\r\nupdated\r\nData Type: Long Integer\r\nDescription: Time when the event was most recently updated.

In this case, time is of the essence in order to broadcast a warning if tsunami waves are likely to be generated by the event. Such preliminary magnitudes are superseded by improved estimates of magnitude as more data become available.\r\n\r\nFor large earthquakes of the present era, the magnitude that is ultimately selected as the preferred magnitude for reporting to the public is commonly a moment magnitude that is based on the scalar seismic-moment of an earthquake determined by calculation of the seismic moment-tensor that best accounts for the character of the seismic waves generated by the earthquake. The scalar seismic-moment, a parameter of the seismic moment-tensor, can also be estimated via the multiplicative product rigidity of faulted rock x area of fault rupture x average fault displacement during the earthquake.\r\n\r\nmagError\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0, 100]\r\nDescription: Uncertainty of reported magnitude of the event. The estimated standard error of the magnitude. The uncertainty corresponds to the specific magnitude type being reported and does not take into account magnitude variations and biases between different magnitude scales. We report an \"unknown\" value if the contributing seismic network does not supply uncertainty estimates.\r\n\r\nmagNst\r\nData Type: Integer\r\nDescription: The total number of seismic stations used to calculate the magnitude for this earthquake.\r\n\r\nmagSource\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: ak, at, ci, hv, ld, mb, nc, nm, nn, pr, pt, se, us, uu, uw\r\nDescription: Network that originally authored the reported magnitude for this event.\r\n\r\nmagType\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: “Md”, “Ml”, “Ms”, “Mw”, “Me”, “Mi”, “Mb”, “MLg”\r\nDescription: The method or algorithm used to calculate the preferred magnitude for the event.\r\nAdditional Information: See Magnitude Types Table.\r\n\r\nmmi\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values:[0.0, 10.0]\r\nDescription: The maximum estimated instrumental intensity for the event.

Increased numbers of arrival-time observations generally result in improved earthquake locations.\r\n\r\nnst\r\nData Type: Integer\r\nDescription: The total number of seismic stations used to determine earthquake location.\r\nAdditional Information: Number of seismic stations which reported P- and S-arrival times for this earthquake. This number may be larger than the Number of Phases Used if arrival times are rejected because the distance to a seismic station exceeds the maximum allowable distance or because the arrival-time observation is inconsistent with the solution.\r\n\r\nplace\r\nData Type: String\r\nDescription: Textual description of named geographic region near to the event. This may be a city name, or a Flinn-Engdahl Region name.\r\nAdditional Information: We use a GeoNames dataset to reference populated places that are in close proximity to a seismic event. GeoNames has compiled a list of cities in the United States where the population is 1,000 or greater (cities1000.txt). This is the primary list that we use when selecting nearby places. In order to provide the public with a better understanding for the location of an event we try to list a variety of places in our nearby places list. This includes the closest known populated place in relation to the seismic event (which based on our dataset will have a population of 1,000 or greater). We also include the next 3 closest places that have a population of 10,000 or greater, and finally make sure to include the closest capital city to the seismic event.\r\n\r\nThe reference point for the descriptive locations is usually either the City Hall of the town (or prominent intersection in the middle of town if there is no City Hall), but please refer to the GeoNames website for the most accurate information on their data.\r\n\r\nIf there is no nearby city within 300 kilometers (or if the nearby cities database is unavailable for some reason), the Flinn-Engdahl (F-E) seismic and geographical regionalization scheme is used. The boundaries of these regions are defined at one-degree intervals and therefore differ from irregular political boundaries. For example, F-E region 545 (Northern Italy) also includes small parts of France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia and F-E region 493 (Chesapeake Bay Region) includes all of the State of Delaware, plus parts of the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Beginning with January 2000, the 1995 revision to the F-E code has been used in the QED and PDE listings.\r\n\r\nAs an agency of the U.S. Government, we are expected to use the names and spellings approved by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. Any requests to approve additional names should be made to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.\r\n\r\nrms\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0.13,1.39]\r\nDescription: The root-mean-square (RMS) travel time residual, in sec, using all weights. This parameter provides a measure of the fit of the observed arrival times to the predicted arrival times for this location. Smaller numbers reflect a better fit of the data. The value is dependent on the accuracy of the velocity model used to compute the earthquake location, the quality weights assigned to the arrival time data, and the procedure used to locate the earthquake.\r\n\r\nsig\r\nData Type: Integer\r\nTypical Values: [0, 1000]\r\nDescription: A number describing how significant the event is. Larger numbers indicate a more significant event. This value is determined on a number of factors, including: magnitude, maximum MMI, felt reports, and estimated impact.\r\n\r\nsources\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: \",us,nc,ci,\"\r\nDescription: A comma-separated list of network contributors.\r\n\r\nstatus\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: “automatic”, “reviewed”, “deleted”\r\nDescription: Indicates whether the event has been reviewed by a human.\r\nAdditional Information\r\nStatus is either automatic or reviewed. Automatic events are directly posted by automatic processing systems and have not been verified or altered by a human. Reviewed events have been looked at by a human. The level of review can range from a quick validity check to a careful reanalysis of the event.\r\n\r\ntime\r\nData Type: Long Integer\r\nDescription: Time when the event occurred. Times are reported in milliseconds since the epoch ( 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z), and do not include leap seconds. In certain output formats, the date is formatted for readability.\r\nAdditional Information: We indicate the date and time when the earthquake initiates rupture, which is known as the \"origin\" time. Note that large earthquakes can continue rupturing for many 10's of seconds. We provide time in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). Seismologists use UTC to avoid confusion caused by local time zones and daylight savings time. On the individual event pages, times are also provided for the time at the epicenter, and your local time based on the time your computer is set.\r\n\r\ntsunami\r\nData Type: Integer\r\nDescription: This flag is set to \"1\" for large events in oceanic regions and \"0\" otherwise. The existence or value of this flag does not indicate if a tsunami actually did or will exist.

					"description": "GeoJSON file for earthquake centers over a magnitude of 4.5 for the Pacific Islands Region for years 2010-2014. Data are derived from the ANSS Comprehensive Earthquake Catalog (ComCat). ComCat contains earthquake source parameters (e.g. hypocenters, magnitudes, phase picks and amplitudes) and other products (e.g. moment tensor solutions, macroseismic information, tectonic summaries, maps) produced by contributing seismic networks.\r\n\r\nFields are defined below:\r\nalert\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: “green”, “yellow”, “orange”, “red”.\r\nDescription: The alert level from the PAGER earthquake impact scale.\r\n\r\ncdi\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0.0, 10.0]\r\nDescription: The maximum reported intensity for the event.

This depth may be relative to the WGS84 geoid, mean sea-level, or the average elevation of the seismic stations which provided arrival-time data for the earthquake location. The choice of reference depth is dependent on the method used to locate the earthquake, which varies by seismic network. Since ComCat includes data from many different seismic networks, the process for determining the depth is different for different events. The depth is the least-constrained parameter in the earthquake location, and the error bars are generally larger than the variation due to different depth determination methods.\r\n\r\nSometimes when depth is poorly constrained by available seismic data, the location program will set the depth at a fixed value. For example, 33 km is often used as a default depth for earthquakes determined to be shallow, but whose depth is not satisfactorily determined by the data, whereas default depths of 5 or 10 km are often used in mid-continental areas and on mid-ocean ridges since earthquakes in these areas are usually shallower than 33 km.\r\n\r\ndepthError\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0, 100]\r\nDescription: Uncertainty of reported depth of the event in kilometers.\r\nAdditional Information: The depth error, in km, defined as the largest projection of the three principal errors on a vertical line.\r\n\r\ndetail\r\nData Type: String\r\nDescription: Link to GeoJSON detail feed from a GeoJSON summary feed.\r\nNOTE: When searching and using geojson with callback, no callback is included in the detail url.\r\n\r\ndmin\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0.4, 7.1]\r\nDescription: Horizontal distance from the epicenter to the nearest station (in degrees). 1 degree is approximately 111.2 kilometers.

In general, the smaller this number, the more reliable is the calculated horizontal position of the earthquake. Earthquake locations in which the azimuthal gap exceeds 180 degrees typically have large location and depth uncertainties.\r\n\r\nhorizontalError\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0, 100]\r\nDescription: Uncertainty of reported location of the event in kilometers.\r\nAdditional Information: The horizontal location error, in km, defined as the length of the largest projection of the three principal errors on a horizontal plane. The principal errors are the major axes of the error ellipsoid, and are mutually perpendicular. The horizontal and vertical uncertainties in an event's location varies from about 100 m horizontally and 300 meters vertically for the best located events, those in the middle of densely spaced seismograph networks, to 10s of kilometers for global events in many parts of the world. We report an \"unknown\" value if the contributing seismic network does not supply uncertainty estimates.\r\n\r\nid\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: A (generally) two-character network identifier with a (generally) eight-character network-assigned code.\r\nDescription: A unique identifier for the event.

Negative values for southern latitudes.\r\nAdditional Information: An earthquake begins to rupture at a hypocenter which is defined by a position on the surface of the earth (epicenter) and a depth below this point (focal depth). We provide the coordinates of the epicenter in units of latitude and longitude. The latitude is the number of degrees north (N) or south (S) of the equator and varies from 0 at the equator to 90 at the poles. The longitude is the number of degrees east (E) or west (W) of the prime meridian which runs through Greenwich, England. The longitude varies from 0 at Greenwich to 180 and the E or W shows the direction from Greenwich. Coordinates are given in the WGS84 reference frame. The position uncertainty of the hypocenter location varies from about 100 m horizontally and 300 meters vertically for the best located events, those in the middle of densely spaced seismograph networks, to 10s of kilometers for global events in many parts of the world.\r\n\r\nlocationSource\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: ak, at, ci, hv, ld, mb, nc, nm, nn, pr, pt, se, us, uu, uw\r\nDescription: The network that originally authored the reported location of this event.\r\n\r\nlongitude\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [-180.0, 180.0]\r\nDescription: Decimal degrees longitude.

See also magType.\r\nAdditional Information: The magnitude reported is that which the U.S. Geological Survey considers official for this earthquake, and was the best available estimate of the earthquake’s size, at the time that this page was created. Other magnitudes associated with web pages linked from here are those determined at various times following the earthquake with different types of seismic data. Although they are legitimate estimates of magnitude, the U.S. Geological Survey does not consider them to be the preferred \"official\" magnitude for the event.\r\n\r\nEarthquake magnitude is a measure of the size of an earthquake at its source. It is a logarithmic measure. At the same distance from the earthquake, the amplitude of the seismic waves from which the magnitude is determined are approximately 10 times as large during a magnitude 5 earthquake as during a magnitude 4 earthquake. The total amount of energy released by the earthquake usually goes up by a larger factor: for many commonly used magnitude types, the total energy of an average earthquake goes up by a factor of approximately 32 for each unit increase in magnitude.\r\n\r\nThere are various ways that magnitude may be calculated from seismograms. Different methods are effective for different sizes of earthquakes and different distances between the earthquake source and the recording station. The various magnitude types are generally defined so as to yield magnitude values that agree to within a few-tenths of a magnitude-unit for earthquakes in a middle range of recorded-earthquake sizes, but the various magnitude-types may have values that differ by more than a magnitude-unit for very large and very small earthquakes as well as for some specific classes of seismic source. This is because earthquakes are commonly complex events that release energy over a wide range of frequencies and at varying amounts as the faulting or rupture process occurs. The various types of magnitude measure different aspects of the seismic radiation (e.g., low-frequency energy vs. high-frequency energy). The relationship among values of different magnitude types that are assigned to a particular seismic event may enable the seismologist to better understand the processes at the focus of the seismic event. The various magnitude-types are not all available at the same time for a particular earthquake.\r\n\r\nPreliminary magnitudes based on incomplete but rapidly-available data are sometimes estimated and reported. For example, the Tsunami Warning Centers will calculate a preliminary magnitude and location for an event as soon as sufficient data are available to make an estimate.

In general, the smaller this number, the more reliable is the calculated depth of the earthquake.\r\n\r\nfelt\r\nData Type: Integer\r\nTypical Values: [44, 843]\r\nDescription: The total number of felt reports submitted to the DYFI? system.\r\n\r\ngap\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0.0, 180.0]\r\nDescription: The largest azimuthal gap between azimuthally adjacent stations (in degrees). In general, the smaller this number, the more reliable is the calculated horizontal position of the earthquake. Earthquake locations in which the azimuthal gap exceeds 180 degrees typically have large location and depth uncertainties.\r\n\r\nhorizontalError\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0, 100]\r\nDescription: Uncertainty of reported location of the event in kilometers.\r\nAdditional Information: The horizontal location error, in km, defined as the length of the largest projection of the three principal errors on a horizontal plane. The principal errors are the major axes of the error ellipsoid, and are mutually perpendicular. The horizontal and vertical uncertainties in an event's location varies from about 100 m horizontally and 300 meters vertically for the best located events, those in the middle of densely spaced seismograph networks, to 10s of kilometers for global events in many parts of the world. We report an \"unknown\" value if the contributing seismic network does not supply uncertainty estimates.\r\n\r\nid\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: A (generally) two-character network identifier with a (generally) eight-character network-assigned code.\r\nDescription: A unique identifier for the event.

Negative values for southern latitudes.\r\nAdditional Information: An earthquake begins to rupture at a hypocenter which is defined by a position on the surface of the earth (epicenter) and a depth below this point (focal depth). We provide the coordinates of the epicenter in units of latitude and longitude. The latitude is the number of degrees north (N) or south (S) of the equator and varies from 0 at the equator to 90 at the poles. The longitude is the number of degrees east (E) or west (W) of the prime meridian which runs through Greenwich, England. The longitude varies from 0 at Greenwich to 180 and the E or W shows the direction from Greenwich. Coordinates are given in the WGS84 reference frame. The position uncertainty of the hypocenter location varies from about 100 m horizontally and 300 meters vertically for the best located events, those in the middle of densely spaced seismograph networks, to 10s of kilometers for global events in many parts of the world.\r\n\r\nlocationSource\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: ak, at, ci, hv, ld, mb, nc, nm, nn, pr, pt, se, us, uu, uw\r\nDescription: The network that originally authored the reported location of this event.\r\n\r\nlongitude\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [-180.0, 180.0]\r\nDescription: Decimal degrees longitude. Negative values for western longitudes.\r\nAdditional Information: An earthquake begins to rupture at a hypocenter which is defined by a position on the surface of the earth (epicenter) and a depth below this point (focal depth).

See also magType.\r\nAdditional Information: The magnitude reported is that which the U.S. Geological Survey considers official for this earthquake, and was the best available estimate of the earthquake’s size, at the time that this page was created. Other magnitudes associated with web pages linked from here are those determined at various times following the earthquake with different types of seismic data. Although they are legitimate estimates of magnitude, the U.S. Geological Survey does not consider them to be the preferred \"official\" magnitude for the event.\r\n\r\nEarthquake magnitude is a measure of the size of an earthquake at its source. It is a logarithmic measure. At the same distance from the earthquake, the amplitude of the seismic waves from which the magnitude is determined are approximately 10 times as large during a magnitude 5 earthquake as during a magnitude 4 earthquake. The total amount of energy released by the earthquake usually goes up by a larger factor: for many commonly used magnitude types, the total energy of an average earthquake goes up by a factor of approximately 32 for each unit increase in magnitude.\r\n\r\nThere are various ways that magnitude may be calculated from seismograms. Different methods are effective for different sizes of earthquakes and different distances between the earthquake source and the recording station. The various magnitude types are generally defined so as to yield magnitude values that agree to within a few-tenths of a magnitude-unit for earthquakes in a middle range of recorded-earthquake sizes, but the various magnitude-types may have values that differ by more than a magnitude-unit for very large and very small earthquakes as well as for some specific classes of seismic source. This is because earthquakes are commonly complex events that release energy over a wide range of frequencies and at varying amounts as the faulting or rupture process occurs. The various types of magnitude measure different aspects of the seismic radiation (e.g., low-frequency energy vs. high-frequency energy). The relationship among values of different magnitude types that are assigned to a particular seismic event may enable the seismologist to better understand the processes at the focus of the seismic event. The various magnitude-types are not all available at the same time for a particular earthquake.\r\n\r\nPreliminary magnitudes based on incomplete but rapidly-available data are sometimes estimated and reported. For example, the Tsunami Warning Centers will calculate a preliminary magnitude and location for an event as soon as sufficient data are available to make an estimate. In this case, time is of the essence in order to broadcast a warning if tsunami waves are likely to be generated by the event. Such preliminary magnitudes are superseded by improved estimates of magnitude as more data become available.\r\n\r\nFor large earthquakes of the present era, the magnitude that is ultimately selected as the preferred magnitude for reporting to the public is commonly a moment magnitude that is based on the scalar seismic-moment of an earthquake determined by calculation of the seismic moment-tensor that best accounts for the character of the seismic waves generated by the earthquake. The scalar seismic-moment, a parameter of the seismic moment-tensor, can also be estimated via the multiplicative product rigidity of faulted rock x area of fault rupture x average fault displacement during the earthquake.\r\n\r\nmagError\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0, 100]\r\nDescription: Uncertainty of reported magnitude of the event. The estimated standard error of the magnitude. The uncertainty corresponds to the specific magnitude type being reported and does not take into account magnitude variations and biases between different magnitude scales. We report an \"unknown\" value if the contributing seismic network does not supply uncertainty estimates.\r\n\r\nmagNst\r\nData Type: Integer\r\nDescription: The total number of seismic stations used to calculate the magnitude for this earthquake.\r\n\r\nmagSource\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: ak, at, ci, hv, ld, mb, nc, nm, nn, pr, pt, se, us, uu, uw\r\nDescription: Network that originally authored the reported magnitude for this event.\r\n\r\nmagType\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: “Md”, “Ml”, “Ms”, “Mw”, “Me”, “Mi”, “Mb”, “MLg”\r\nDescription: The method or algorithm used to calculate the preferred magnitude for the event.\r\nAdditional Information: See Magnitude Types Table.\r\n\r\nmmi\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values:[0.0, 10.0]\r\nDescription: The maximum estimated instrumental intensity for the event. Computed by ShakeMap. While typically reported as a roman numeral, for the purposes of this API, intensity is expected as the decimal equivalent of the roman numeral. Learn more about magnitude vs. intensity.\r\n\r\nnet\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: ak, at, ci, hv, ld, mb, nc, nm, nn, pr, pt, se, us, uu, uw\r\nDescription: The ID of a data contributor. Identifies the network considered to be the preferred source of information for this event.\r\n\r\nnph\r\nData Type: String\r\nDescription: Number of Phases Used. Number of P and S arrival-time observations used to compute the hypocenter location. Increased numbers of arrival-time observations generally result in improved earthquake locations.\r\n\r\nnst\r\nData Type: Integer\r\nDescription: The total number of seismic stations used to determine earthquake location.\r\nAdditional Information: Number of seismic stations which reported P- and S-arrival times for this earthquake. This number may be larger than the Number of Phases Used if arrival times are rejected because the distance to a seismic station exceeds the maximum allowable distance or because the arrival-time observation is inconsistent with the solution.\r\n\r\nplace\r\nData Type: String\r\nDescription: Textual description of named geographic region near to the event. This may be a city name, or a Flinn-Engdahl Region name.\r\nAdditional Information: We use a GeoNames dataset to reference populated places that are in close proximity to a seismic event. GeoNames has compiled a list of cities in the United States where the population is 1,000 or greater (cities1000.txt). This is the primary list that we use when selecting nearby places. In order to provide the public with a better understanding for the location of an event we try to list a variety of places in our nearby places list. This includes the closest known populated place in relation to the seismic event (which based on our dataset will have a population of 1,000 or greater). We also include the next 3 closest places that have a population of 10,000 or greater, and finally make sure to include the closest capital city to the seismic event.\r\n\r\nThe reference point for the descriptive locations is usually either the City Hall of the town (or prominent intersection in the middle of town if there is no City Hall), but please refer to the GeoNames website for the most accurate information on their data.\r\n\r\nIf there is no nearby city within 300 kilometers (or if the nearby cities database is unavailable for some reason), the Flinn-Engdahl (F-E) seismic and geographical regionalization scheme is used. The boundaries of these regions are defined at one-degree intervals and therefore differ from irregular political boundaries. For example, F-E region 545 (Northern Italy) also includes small parts of France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia and F-E region 493 (Chesapeake Bay Region) includes all of the State of Delaware, plus parts of the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Beginning with January 2000, the 1995 revision to the F-E code has been used in the QED and PDE listings.\r\n\r\nAs an agency of the U.S. Government, we are expected to use the names and spellings approved by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. Any requests to approve additional names should be made to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.\r\n\r\nrms\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0.13,1.39]\r\nDescription: The root-mean-square (RMS) travel time residual, in sec, using all weights. This parameter provides a measure of the fit of the observed arrival times to the predicted arrival times for this location. Smaller numbers reflect a better fit of the data. The value is dependent on the accuracy of the velocity model used to compute the earthquake location, the quality weights assigned to the arrival time data, and the procedure used to locate the earthquake.\r\n\r\nsig\r\nData Type: Integer\r\nTypical Values: [0, 1000]\r\nDescription: A number describing how significant the event is. Larger numbers indicate a more significant event. This value is determined on a number of factors, including: magnitude, maximum MMI, felt reports, and estimated impact.\r\n\r\nsources\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: \",us,nc,ci,\"\r\nDescription: A comma-separated list of network contributors.\r\n\r\nstatus\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: “automatic”, “reviewed”, “deleted”\r\nDescription: Indicates whether the event has been reviewed by a human.\r\nAdditional Information\r\nStatus is either automatic or reviewed. Automatic events are directly posted by automatic processing systems and have not been verified or altered by a human. Reviewed events have been looked at by a human. The level of review can range from a quick validity check to a careful reanalysis of the event.\r\n\r\ntime\r\nData Type: Long Integer\r\nDescription: Time when the event occurred. Times are reported in milliseconds since the epoch ( 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z), and do not include leap seconds. In certain output formats, the date is formatted for readability.\r\nAdditional Information: We indicate the date and time when the earthquake initiates rupture, which is known as the \"origin\" time. Note that large earthquakes can continue rupturing for many 10's of seconds. We provide time in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). Seismologists use UTC to avoid confusion caused by local time zones and daylight savings time. On the individual event pages, times are also provided for the time at the epicenter, and your local time based on the time your computer is set.\r\n\r\ntsunami\r\nData Type: Integer\r\nDescription: This flag is set to \"1\" for large events in oceanic regions and \"0\" otherwise. The existence or value of this flag does not indicate if a tsunami actually did or will exist. If the flag value is \"1\", the event will include a link to the NOAA Tsunami website for tsunami information. The USGS is not responsible for Tsunami warning; we are simply providing a link to the authoritative NOAA source.\r\nSee http://www.tsunami.gov/ for all current tsunami alert statuses.\r\n\r\ntype\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: “earthquake”, “quarry”\r\nDescription: Type of seismic event.\r\n\r\ntypes\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: “,cap,dyfi,general-link,origin,p-wave-travel-times,phase-data,”\r\nDescription: A comma-separated list of product types associated to this event.\r\ntz\r\nData Type: Integer\r\nTypical Values: [-1200, +1200]\r\nDescription: Timezone offset from UTC in minutes at the event epicenter.\r\n\r\nupdated\r\nData Type: Long Integer\r\nDescription: Time when the event was most recently updated.

Data are derived from the ANSS Comprehensive Earthquake Catalog (ComCat). ComCat contains earthquake source parameters (e.g. hypocenters, magnitudes, phase picks and amplitudes) and other products (e.g. moment tensor solutions, macroseismic information, tectonic summaries, maps) produced by contributing seismic networks.\r\n\r\nFields are defined below:\r\nalert\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: “green”, “yellow”, “orange”, “red”.\r\nDescription: The alert level from the PAGER earthquake impact scale.\r\n\r\ncdi\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0.0, 10.0]\r\nDescription: The maximum reported intensity for the event.

This depth may be relative to the WGS84 geoid, mean sea-level, or the average elevation of the seismic stations which provided arrival-time data for the earthquake location. The choice of reference depth is dependent on the method used to locate the earthquake, which varies by seismic network. Since ComCat includes data from many different seismic networks, the process for determining the depth is different for different events. The depth is the least-constrained parameter in the earthquake location, and the error bars are generally larger than the variation due to different depth determination methods.\r\n\r\nSometimes when depth is poorly constrained by available seismic data, the location program will set the depth at a fixed value. For example, 33 km is often used as a default depth for earthquakes determined to be shallow, but whose depth is not satisfactorily determined by the data, whereas default depths of 5 or 10 km are often used in mid-continental areas and on mid-ocean ridges since earthquakes in these areas are usually shallower than 33 km.\r\n\r\ndepthError\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0, 100]\r\nDescription: Uncertainty of reported depth of the event in kilometers.\r\nAdditional Information: The depth error, in km, defined as the largest projection of the three principal errors on a vertical line.\r\n\r\ndetail\r\nData Type: String\r\nDescription: Link to GeoJSON detail feed from a GeoJSON summary feed.\r\nNOTE: When searching and using geojson with callback, no callback is included in the detail url.\r\n\r\ndmin\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0.4, 7.1]\r\nDescription: Horizontal distance from the epicenter to the nearest station (in degrees). 1 degree is approximately 111.2 kilometers.

In general, the smaller this number, the more reliable is the calculated horizontal position of the earthquake. Earthquake locations in which the azimuthal gap exceeds 180 degrees typically have large location and depth uncertainties.\r\n\r\nhorizontalError\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0, 100]\r\nDescription: Uncertainty of reported location of the event in kilometers.\r\nAdditional Information: The horizontal location error, in km, defined as the length of the largest projection of the three principal errors on a horizontal plane. The principal errors are the major axes of the error ellipsoid, and are mutually perpendicular. The horizontal and vertical uncertainties in an event's location varies from about 100 m horizontally and 300 meters vertically for the best located events, those in the middle of densely spaced seismograph networks, to 10s of kilometers for global events in many parts of the world.

Negative values for southern latitudes.\r\nAdditional Information: An earthquake begins to rupture at a hypocenter which is defined by a position on the surface of the earth (epicenter) and a depth below this point (focal depth). We provide the coordinates of the epicenter in units of latitude and longitude. The latitude is the number of degrees north (N) or south (S) of the equator and varies from 0 at the equator to 90 at the poles. The longitude is the number of degrees east (E) or west (W) of the prime meridian which runs through Greenwich, England. The longitude varies from 0 at Greenwich to 180 and the E or W shows the direction from Greenwich. Coordinates are given in the WGS84 reference frame.

This may be a city name, or a Flinn-Engdahl Region name.\r\nAdditional Information: We use a GeoNames dataset to reference populated places that are in close proximity to a seismic event. GeoNames has compiled a list of cities in the United States where the population is 1,000 or greater (cities1000.txt). This is the primary list that we use when selecting nearby places.

Beginning with January 2000, the 1995 revision to the F-E code has been used in the QED and PDE listings.\r\n\r\nAs an agency of the U.S. Government, we are expected to use the names and spellings approved by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. Any requests to approve additional names should be made to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.\r\n\r\nrms\r\nData Type: Decimal\r\nTypical Values: [0.13,1.39]\r\nDescription: The root-mean-square (RMS) travel time residual, in sec, using all weights. This parameter provides a measure of the fit of the observed arrival times to the predicted arrival times for this location. Smaller numbers reflect a better fit of the data. The value is dependent on the accuracy of the velocity model used to compute the earthquake location, the quality weights assigned to the arrival time data, and the procedure used to locate the earthquake.\r\n\r\nsig\r\nData Type: Integer\r\nTypical Values: [0, 1000]\r\nDescription: A number describing how significant the event is. Larger numbers indicate a more significant event. This value is determined on a number of factors, including: magnitude, maximum MMI, felt reports, and estimated impact.\r\n\r\nsources\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: \",us,nc,ci,\"\r\nDescription: A comma-separated list of network contributors.\r\n\r\nstatus\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: “automatic”, “reviewed”, “deleted”\r\nDescription: Indicates whether the event has been reviewed by a human.\r\nAdditional Information\r\nStatus is either automatic or reviewed. Automatic events are directly posted by automatic processing systems and have not been verified or altered by a human. Reviewed events have been looked at by a human. The level of review can range from a quick validity check to a careful reanalysis of the event.\r\n\r\ntime\r\nData Type: Long Integer\r\nDescription: Time when the event occurred. Times are reported in milliseconds since the epoch ( 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z), and do not include leap seconds. In certain output formats, the date is formatted for readability.\r\nAdditional Information: We indicate the date and time when the earthquake initiates rupture, which is known as the \"origin\" time. Note that large earthquakes can continue rupturing for many 10's of seconds. We provide time in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). Seismologists use UTC to avoid confusion caused by local time zones and daylight savings time. On the individual event pages, times are also provided for the time at the epicenter, and your local time based on the time your computer is set.\r\n\r\ntsunami\r\nData Type: Integer\r\nDescription: This flag is set to \"1\" for large events in oceanic regions and \"0\" otherwise. The existence or value of this flag does not indicate if a tsunami actually did or will exist. If the flag value is \"1\", the event will include a link to the NOAA Tsunami website for tsunami information. The USGS is not responsible for Tsunami warning; we are simply providing a link to the authoritative NOAA source.\r\nSee http://www.tsunami.gov/ for all current tsunami alert statuses.\r\n\r\ntype\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: “earthquake”, “quarry”\r\nDescription: Type of seismic event.\r\n\r\ntypes\r\nData Type: String\r\nTypical Values: “,cap,dyfi,general-link,origin,p-wave-travel-times,phase-data,”\r\nDescription: A comma-separated list of product types associated to this event.\r\ntz\r\nData Type: Integer\r\nTypical Values: [-1200, +1200]\r\nDescription: Timezone offset from UTC in minutes at the event epicenter.\r\n\r\nupdated\r\nData Type: Long Integer\r\nDescription: Time when the event was most recently updated. Times are reported in milliseconds since the epoch. In certain output formats, the date is formatted for readability.\r\n\r\nurl\r\nData Type: String\r\nDescription: Link to USGS Event Page for event.",

We consider the activity confirmed when indicated by visual observations at the sea floor (i.e., ground-truthing) that may or may not also include temperature measurements.\r\nMaximum Temperature\r\nMaximum Temperature Category\r\nMaximum temperature (degrees C) is provided for confirmed active vent fields; the “cell” is blank if inferred active and “NotApplicable” if inactive. For those confirmed active vent fields in which a maximum temperature is NotProvided, a category is assigned as High if chimneys and/or black smokers were observed or Low if only diffuse venting was observed.

Atlantic, N. Pacific, S. Atlantic, S. Pacific, Southern. Following the standards of the International Hydrographic Organization, the Arctic Ocean includes the mid-ocean ridge north of Iceland, and the Southern Ocean is defined as south of latitude 60 S.\r\nRegion\r\nRegion generally indicates the regional setting of the vent field along the world plate boundaries. Exceptions include vent fields at intra-plate volcanoes and coastal faults. The Region tends to form part of the hierarchical vocabulary for each vent field Name Feature_ID VentField in MGDS.\r\nNational Jurisdiction\r\nNational Jurisdiction within exclusive economic zones (EEZs) was determined by querying the VLIZ Maritime Boundaries Geodatabase (http://www.marineregions.org/eezsearch.php) using the latitude and longitude for each vent field.

			"description": "The Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program (GVP) is housed in the Department of Mineral Sciences, National Museum of Natural History, in Washington D.C. We are devoted to a better understanding of Earth's active volcanoes and their eruptions during the last 10,000 years.\r\n\r\nThe mission of GVP is to document, understand, and disseminate information about global volcanic activity. We do this through four core functions: reporting, archiving, research, and outreach. The data systems that lie at our core have been in development since 1968 when GVP began documenting the eruptive histories of volcanoes.\r\n\r\nReporting. GVP is unique in its documentation of current and past activity for all volcanoes on the planet active during the last 10,000 years. During the early stages of an eruption anywhere in the world we act as a clearinghouse of reports, data, and imagery. Reports are released in two formats. The Smithsonian / USGS Weekly Volcanic Activity Report provides timely information vetted by GVP staff about current eruptions. The Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network provides comprehensive reporting on recent eruptions on a longer time horizon to allow incorporation of peer-reviewed literature and observatory reports.\r\n\r\nArchiving. Complementing our effort toward reporting of current eruptive activity is our database of volcanoes and eruptions that documents the last 10,000 years of Earth's volcanism. These databases and interpretations based on them were published in three editions of the book \"Volcanoes of the World\".\r\n\r\nResearch. GVP researchers are curators in the Department of Mineral Sciences and maintain active research programs on volcanic products, processes, and the deep Earth that is the ultimate source of volcanism.\r\n\r\nOutreach. This website presents more than 7,000 reports on volcanic activity, provides access to the baseline data and eruptive histories of Holocene volcanoes, and makes available other resources to our international partners, scientists, civil-authorities, and the public.\r\n\r\nThe Global Volcanism Program relies on an international network of collaborating individuals, programs and organizations, many of which are listed below:\r\n\r\nUnited States Geological Survey Volcano Hazards Program (USA). The Volcano Hazards Program monitors active and potentially active volcanoes, assesses their hazards, responds to volcanic crises, and conducts research on volcanoes. The Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) (with the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance) works to reduce fatalities and economic losses in countries experiencing a volcano emergency.\r\n\r\nGlobal Volcano Model (Bristol University and the British Geological Survey, UK). GVM is a growing international network that aims to create a sustainable, accessible information platform on volcanic hazard and risk.\r\n\r\nWOVOdat (Earth Observatory of Singapore). A collective record of volcano monitoring, worldwide - brought to you by the WOVO (World Organization of Volcano Observatories).\r\n\r\nIntegrated Earth Data Applications (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, USA). A community-based data facility to support, sustain, and advance the geosciences by providing data services for observational solid earth data from the Ocean, Earth, and Polar Sciences.\r\n\r\nVHub (The State University of New York at Buffalo, USA). An online resource for collaboration in volcanology research and risk mitigation.\r\n\r\nInternational Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (IAVCEI). IAVCEI represents the primary international focus for: (1) research in volcanology, (2) efforts to mitigate volcanic disasters, and (3) research into closely related disciplines, such as igneous geochemistry and petrology, geochronology, volcanogenic mineral deposits, and the physics of the generation and ascent of magmas in the upper mantle and crust. IAVCEI has charged GVP with providing the official names and unique identifier numbers for the world's volcanoes.\r\n\r\nNational Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAACs) The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has established nine Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers tasked with monitoring Volcanic Ash plumes within their assigned airspace.",

The data are available for global-scale applications at a spatial resolution of 5 arcmin (approximately 9.2 km at the equator).\r\n\r\nLinking biodiversity occurrence data to the physical and biotic environment provides a framework to formulate hypotheses about the ecological processes governing spatial and temporal patterns in biodiversity, which can be useful for marine ecosystem management and conservation.\r\n\r\nBio-ORACLE offers a user-friendly solution to accomplish this task by providing 18 global geophysical, biotic and climate layers at a common spatial resolution (5 arcmin) and a uniform landmask.\r\n\r\nThe data available in Bio-ORACLE are documented in two peer reviewed articles that you should cite:\r\nTyberghein L, Verbruggen H, Pauly K, Troupin C, Mineur F, De Clerck O (2012) Bio-ORACLE: A global environmental dataset for marine species distribution modelling.

			"description": "<p>The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is the most comprehensive global database of marine and terrestrial protected areas, updated on a monthly basis, and is one of the key global biodiversity data sets being widely used by scientists, businesses, governments, International secretariats and others to inform planning, policy decisions and management. The WDPA is a joint project between UN Environment and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The compilation and management of the WDPA is carried out by UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), in collaboration with governments, non-governmental organisations, academia and industry. There are monthly updates of the data which are made available online through the Protected Planet website where the data is both viewable and downloadable. Data and information on the world's protected areas compiled in the WDPA are used for reporting to the Convention on Biological Diversity on progress towards reaching the Aichi Biodiversity Targets (particularly Target 11), to the UN to track progress towards the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, to some of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) core indicators, and other international assessments and reports including the Global Biodiversity Outlook, as well as for the publication of the United Nations List of Protected Areas. Every two years, UNEP-WCMC releases the Protected Planet Report on the status of the world's protected areas and recommendations on how to meet international goals and targets. Many platforms are incorporating the WDPA to provide integrated information to diverse users, including businesses and governments, in a range of sectors including mining, oil and gas, and finance. For example, the WDPA is included in the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool, an innovative decision support tool that gives users easy access to up-to-date information that allows them to identify biodiversity risks and opportunities within a project boundary. The reach of the WDPA is further enhanced in services developed by other parties, such as the Global Forest Watch and the Digital Observatory for Protected Areas, which provide decision makers with access to monitoring and alert systems that allow whole landscapes to be managed better. Together, these applications of the WDPA demonstrate the growing value and significance of the Protected Planet initiative.</p>\r\n",

In addition to the coastal population estimates, the study compares the results obtained from the use of national population datasets (census) with those derived from the use of global population grids. * Accuracy and reliability from national and global datasets derived results have been evaluated to identify the most suitable options to estimate size and location of coastal populations in the region. *A collaborative project between the Pacific Community (SPC), WorldFish and the University of Wollongong has produced the first detailed population estimates of people living close to the coast in the 22 Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs).*</p>\r\n",

			"description": "Verbesina encelioides, a gray, golden crownbeard,  is a sunflower-like herbaceous annual plant ranging in height from 0.3 to 1.7 m with showy yellow flowers. It is native to the southwestern United States, the Mexican Plateau, and other parts of tropical America. Its invasive characteristics include high seed production (as many as 300–350 seeds per flower and multiple flowers per plant), seed dormancy, ability to tolerate dry conditions, and possible allelopathic effects. Many other Pacific islands with similar habitats could be invaded by V. encelioides\r\n\r\n This research stresses out that Verbesina encelioides can be controlled via herbicides or mechanical means, but measures must be repeated due to the presence of persistent seed banks. Further research on V. encelioides is needed to understand its population dynamics, allelopathic properties, and impacts on natural ecosystems.",

The indicators used are those considered to best provide an overview of the key issues facing conservation in Oceania, whilst recognizing the need to use indicators for which a reasonable amount of information was thought to be available. The indicators provide information about the state of ecosystems and species, pressures acting upon these ecosystems and species, and what action is being taken to halt further loss or degradation and improve long-term sustainability.",

Besides market opportunities, organic agriculture could increase PICs food self-reliance and thus, contribute to reducing the alarming trend of dependency on food imports, as well as improving nutrition. This Report explores the potential of organic agriculture and fair trade in PICs, with a specific focus on five main commodities: cacao, coffee, pepper, vanilla and virgin coconut oil.",

After several years of negotiations, the Protocol, known as the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, was finalized and adopted in Montreal on 29 January 2000 at an extraordinary meeting of the Conference of the Parties. The Protocol thus creates an enabling environment for the environmentally sound application of\r\nbiotechnology, making it possible to derive maximum benefit from the potential that biotechnology has to offer, while minimizing the possible risks to the environment and to human health.",

The ecosystem approach is based on the application of appropriate scientific methodologies focused on levels of biological organization, which encompass\r\nthe essential structure, processes, functions and interactions among organisms and their environment. It also recognizes that humans, with their cultural diversity, are an integral component of many ecosystems. The ecosystem approach is essential in guiding action under the various programmes of work of the\r\nConvention, and in providing linkages between those programmes of work. After all, all biomes, and thus programmes of work, are interconnected in some way, and management action will likely have limited success if these connections are not taken into account.",

It draws on a review of the literature pertaining to all 20 pooling initiatives identified in\r\nthe region, and on interviews of stakeholders involved in many of those initiatives. The study\r\nfinds that experience with pooling among Pacific SIDS has not met the optimistic expectations\r\nof advocates, including development partners. This is the result of the challenges inherent in\r\nvoluntary regionalism, which are exacerbated by the diversity of Pacific island states, political\r\neconomy factors, and issues of accountability and legitimacy. The analysis suggests that\r\nexpansion of regional service provision in the Pacific will be slow, although prospects at the\r\nsub-regional level are more positive.",

					"description": "In contrast to the properly grim outlook of just a few decades ago, these are pretty good times for sea turtles. In a 2017 paper titled “Global Sea Turtle Conservation Successes,” Antonio Mazaris and colleagues reported that published estimates of sea turtle populations tend to be increasing rather than decreasing globally. We have also seen the status of some species improving in recent Red List assessments led by the IUCN-SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group, with both the leatherback and loggerhead improving to vulnerable globally (from critically endangered and endangered, respectively). Even the world’s most threatened sea turtle species—the Kemp’s ridley, which is still critically endangered— shows signs of a rebound (see pp. 32–33). Olive ridleys are smashing past abundance records at their arribada beach in Escobilla, Mexico, and SWOT Reports have shared many accounts of recovery, ranging from Michoacán black turtles (pp. 44–45), to the sea turtles of Japan (pp. 24–31) and Brazil, the Hawaiian honu, Cyprus greens, and loggerheads in Kyparissia Bay, Greece, to name a few.",

A summary of the database can be found below.  \r\n\r\nThe Turtle Research and Monitoring Database System (TREDS) provides invaluable information for Pacific island countries and territories to manage their turtle resources. TREDS can be used to collate data from strandings, tagging, nesting, emergence and beach surveys as well as other biological data on turtles.\r\n\r\nTREDS can also be used to monitor and sustainably manage marine turtle populations as well as their nesting and foraging sites. This database is currently being trialed in Samoa, American Samoa, Vanuatu, French Polynesia and Fiji.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade and update of the SPREP Regional Turtle Database is an important component of the SPREP Marine Turtle Action Plan 2003-2007, which, in 2003, recommended that the Turtle Research and Monitoring Database System be developed further.\r\n\r\nTREDS was developed through a collaborative effort by the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme, Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, Secretariat of the Pacific Community, NOAA Fisheries, Queensland Government Environmental Protection Agency, South-East Asia Fisheries Development Centre and the Marine Research Foundation.\r\n\r\nThe development of TREDS continues with trials in a few SPREP member countries and territories before it is distributed to the wider SPREP region.",
